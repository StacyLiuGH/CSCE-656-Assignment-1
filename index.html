        <h2>Why I Attend This Class</h2>
        <p>This class provides me with an opportunity to deepen my understanding of digital media, 
            particularly in terms of interactive storytelling. 
            I'm interested in exploring how digital technologies can serve as powerful tools to scanffold human embodied interactions and dynamic narrative constructions and enhance human experiences, which is actually my dissertation topic. 
            I hope to gain broader perspectives on interpreting how a digital storytelling platform enages users with multiple sensories and its influence on their cognitive development.

        <h2>Challenge in Media Information Consumption</h2>
        <p>One of the challenges I face is the context-switching problem. Considering todayâ€™s environment of overwhelming information overload, users have to process an enormous anount of data. 
            This might raise various tasks for us to deal with, and we need to frequently switch between different platforms. 
            However, these platforms usually have different interfaces, interactive workflows, and so on. 
            We have to mentally adjust to the environment every time we switch to a new platform. 
            While we may be relatively comfortable with how it works for very common platforms, this familiarity still comes from prolonged training and adaptation.
